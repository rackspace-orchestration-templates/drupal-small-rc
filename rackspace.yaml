  Drupal is an open-source web application framework that allows to PHP
  developers to easily create dynamic websites.
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Drupal, check out [Getting started with Drupal 7
  administration](https://drupal.org/getting-started/7/admin). The getting
  started document will help guide you through the initial steps of checking
  your site's status, customizing your site's information, adding users, and
  more!

  After the stack has been created, you can find the admin username and
  password listed in the "Credentials" section of Stack Details.

  #### Accessing Your Deployment
  If you provided a domain name that is associated with your Rackspace Cloud
  account and chose to create DNS records, you should be able to navigate to
  the provided domain name in your browser. If DNS has not been configured yet,
  please refer to this
  [documentation](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  on how to setup your hosts file to allow your browser to access your
  deployment via domain name. Please note: some applications like WordPress,
  Drupal, and Magento may not work properly unless accessed via domain name.
  DNS should point to the IP address of the Load Balancer.

  #### Migrating an Existing Site
  Moving a Drupal site can be both difficult and time consuming. Drupal Modules
  such as the [Backup and Migrate
  module](http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) can help you move your
  database content. We recommend backing everything up on both the source and
  destination locations before anything is done. The content you want to move
  over will be in the 'sites' directory. If you're running a single Drupal
  site, you may just need the content of 'sites/default/files' along with your
  database. Be careful not to overwrite the settings.php file within your site.
  It contains the database configuration for your site.

  This deployment has all of the core Drupal files in place, and their
  permissions are properly set. Be careful with ownerhip and permissions as you
  move things over. If you're unsure, check the original ownership and
  permissions of the files in this deployment.

  #### Modules
  There are over 22,000 modules that have been created by an enaged developer
  community. The [modules](https://drupal.org/project/Modules) section on
  Drupal's website provides an easy way to search for and research modules.

  #### Scaling out
  This deployment is configured to be able to scale out easily.  However,
  if you are expecting higher levels of traffic, please look into one of our
  larger-scale stacks.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).
  Once the stack has been deployed, Ansible will not run again unless you update the
  stack. **Any changes made to the configuration may be overwritten when the stack
  is updated.**

  Drupal was installed using [Drush](http://www.drush.org/en/master/). Drupal
  is installed into /var/www/vhosts/<YOUR DOMAIN>/ and served by
  [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).

  Because this stack is intended for lower-traffic deployments, there is no
  caching configured.

  [Lsyncd](https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd) has been installed in order to
  sync static content from the Master server to all secondary servers.
  When uploading content, it only needs to be uploaded to the Master node,
  and will be automatically synchronized to all secondary nodes.

  MySQL is being hosted on a Cloud Database instance, running MySQL 5.6.
  Backups for MySQL are provided by [Holland](http://wiki.hollandbackup.org/),
  which is running on the Master server.

  Backups are configured using Cloud Backups.  The Master server is configured
  to back up /var/spool/holland and /var/www once per week, and to retain
  these backups for 30 days.

  In order to restore the Database from backup, you will need to first restore
  /var/spool/holland from the appropriate Cloud Backup.  After you have done so,
  you will need to log into the Master server and restore the Holland backup
  to the Cloud Database via the MySQL client.  For more assistance, please
  contact your Support team.

  Monitoring is configured to verify that Apache is running on both the Master
  and all secondary servers, as well as that the Cloud Load Balancer is
  functioning.  Additionally, the default CPU, RAM, and Filesystem checks
  are in place on all servers.

  #### Updating Drupal
  Drupal does provide community documentation on [how to
  upgrade](https://drupal.org/upgrade) your installation of Drupal. There are
  several steps involved with the upgrade process. First, make sure to backup
  your site files and your database prior to taking any steps to replace the
  core site files. There are number of other tutorials available on places like
  YouTube that can also step you though the upgrade/update process. There is
  not currently a way to perform these upgrades automatically through the admin
  interface.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Additional Notes
  You can add additional servers to this deployment by updating the
  "server_count" parameter for this stack. This deployment is
  intended for low to medium traffic production websites and can be
  scaled as needed to accommodate future growth.

  When scaling this deployment by adjusting the "server_count" parameter,
  make sure that you DO NOT change the "database_flavor" and "database_disk"
  parameters, as this will result in the loss of all data within the
  database.

  This stack will not ensure that Drupal or the servers themselves are
  up-to-date.  You are responsible for ensuring that all software is
  updated.

  This stack is intended for low to medium traffic production
  websites and can be scaled as needed to accommodate future
  growth.  This stack includes a Cloud Load Balancer, Cloud
  Database, and a Master server (plus optional secondary
  servers).  It also includes Cloud Monitoring and Cloud
  Backups.

  This stack is running the latest version of
  [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/),
  [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/),
  and [PHP FPM](http://php-fpm.org/).
  with a Cloud Database running
  [MySQL 5.6](http://www.mysql.com/about/).

  This template will only function with RackConnect v3.
